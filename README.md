# Copy number analysis, mutational signatures, mutational signatures from copy number and fusion transcripts detection.

In this repository you will find the corresponding information for the analyses mentioned in the title. Each foldr contains the same basic sub-folders structure:

1. A main README.md file, providing details and references from the analysis.
2. A folder /bin, which contains the scripts.
3. A folder /data, which contains the input link/information used for executing the analysis.   
4. A folder /results, which contains the outputs from the module. 

Note: "Mutational signatures from CN" scripts are located inside the folder /MutationalSignatures.

Information related to our R and Python sessions could be find in this repository, in "PythonSessionInfo.txt" and "renv.lock".
